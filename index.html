      <h3>Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h3>
      <p>In today's world, we receive a lot of information from social media, news websites, and videos. Not everything we see is true or reliable. That’s why critical thinking is so important. It helps us question, analyze and make better decisions.</p>
      <p>Media literacy means understanding how media works and how it can influence us. By combining both skills, we can protect ourselves from fake news and form our own opinions based on facts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask questions: Who created this? Why?</li>
        <li>Look for evidence: Is it supported by facts?</li>
        <li>Think for yourself: Don’t believe everything immediately.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Crime and Punishment</h3>
      <p>Crime and punishment are important issues in every society. Crimes can have many causes, like poverty, lack of education, or social problems. It’s not only about punishing criminals, but also about preventing crime.</p>
      <p>Justice systems try to punish fairly and protect people. However, sometimes they fail. We must also think about rehabilitation—helping people who committed crimes to change and rejoin society. This way, we create a safer and more just world.</p>
